Duplicate content cure is a simple plugin that improves SEO by preventing search engines from indexing pages that contain duplicate content.

== Description ==
Duplicate Content Cure is an extremely simple plugin that makes WordPress more Search Engine
friendly (And therefore improving SEO). It does this by preventing search engine spiders/bots
from accessing pages like Archives, Tags, and Categories, which tend to contain duplicated content
from elsewhere on your site.  This is achieved by adding nofollow, noindex to 
these problem pages.

Duplicate Content Cure doesn't have a lot of features that other SEO plugins have, but
it also is lightning fast by comparison.


== Installation ==
1. download the plugin
2. Unzip the downloaded plugin and upload the duplicate-content-cure directory to your plugins directory
3. By default, everything but Pages, Posts, the Home Page, and the blog home page will have the "noindex,follow" tag added. If you wish to
allow your category or tag pages to be indexed, just go into the settings and uncheck those you want indexed.
